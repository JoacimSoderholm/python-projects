1
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:27,014
- Excuse me, is this your car?
- No.

2
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,178
Okay, lads!

3
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,659
What the hell are you doing?!

4
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:44,014
- I just went to collect some flight tickets.
- I'm only doing my job.

5
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,568
You're punishing honest drivers,
but to straighten out the youth you can't handle!

6
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,900
Bloody guardian mentality!

7
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:04,534
- Isn't it tough when everyone yells?
- Yes it is, but I'm only doing my job.

8
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,494
Luckily I'm going on vacation.

9
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:15,139
- Where are you going?
- To Nueva Estocolmo for Christmas.

10
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:21,290
- I'm also thinking of that.
- So then we might see each other there.

11
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,332
So it is a safe buy then?

12
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:50,490
Sure - highest Swedish standard
and a good location.

13
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,610
Nueva Estocolmo
- a fail-safe investment.

14
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,056
We've been thinking about a cottage.
- now that the loans have been paid and everything.

15
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,809
Not with black money, Levander.

16
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,696
- How are we to do with the money?
- Operation Christmas present.

17
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,653
They don't care about the charter tourists.

18
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,809
- A Christmas present?
- All customs officials have been kids.

19
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:31,495
It is emotionally right.
Psychology, Levander.

20
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,613
Psychology?

21
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,337
<i>Es una iglesia.</i>

22
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,250
<i>Es una iglesia. It is a church</i>

23
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:52,899
- I hope we won't get use of that.
- Me to.

24
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,130
- Is Gösta married?
- Yes.

25
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,289
But she isn't allowed to come.
Isn't that typical?

26
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,851
It will be such fun going!

27
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:24,819
It must be nice after the divorce,
not to be alone on Christmas.

28
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,209
We must turn side of the record.

29
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,175
Oops, I think
the sangria went to the knees!

30
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:42,331
- Do you think we'll meet any 10 point guys?
- Quit it, I'm tired of men!

31
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,293
You've only been unlucky.
Good that you got rid of Sture.

32
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:56,336
- There was nothing wrong with Sture.
- Are you defending him now? God!

33
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:05,335
Just the name - Sture! Could he talk about
something else than football and baked beans?

34
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,933
10... 20... 30...

35
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,729
...40 ... 50000

36
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:26,132
Does this look innocent to you? Now we
only have to find someone to transport it.

37
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,491
Won't you do that?

38
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:35,218
- You said it was fail-safe
- It is fail-safe

39
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,571
- I dread the flight.
- It will be alright.

40
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:49,539
A large whiskey and Sivan Åman is
in shape. Worst case I'll have to take Valium.

41
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,849
I read about some fear of flight clinic.
You attend some sort of therapy.

42
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:02,932
I thought you were through with psychologists.
Sorry...

43
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,450
Do you have to work down there?

44
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:14,089
Gösta is buying a bungalow,
or what they're called, for some customer.

45
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,135
- Are you... I mean, have you...
- Are you out of your mind!

46
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,697
Of course he checks me out from time to time.

47
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,449
Then I use to have tight
skirts and cut lows.

48
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,850
Fill out this form with social security number
and have a seat and wait.

49
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,614
Fear is normal in
the human defense system.

50
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:55,932
In stress- and defense states
you have to be able to relax. Do like this.

51
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:00,338
Stretch out your arms - straight out.

52
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,328
Relax.

53
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,532
Close your eyes.

54
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,779
Feel how relaxed your arms are.

55
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,939
Then take a deep breath.

56
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:25,371
Say after me:
I can fly, I'm not afraid.

57
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,529
I can fly, I'm not afraid.

58
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,617
Do this exercise every time you feel tendencies
to fear of flight.

59
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,336
Hallo?

60
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,419
OK, that's it!

61
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:59,219
- Your going on Saturday, right?
- Yes...

62
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,810
Could I ask a favor of you?

63
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:09,539
<i>I have a relative at the Canary Islands that
lives there due to his Epicondytilis humeri.</i>

64
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:15,770
I would like to send her a Christmas greeting.
this package.

65
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:23,295
Could you bring it with you and leave
it at the Viking Bar in Nueva Estocolmo?

66
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:29,769
- Viking Bar in Nueva Estocolmo.
- Really nice of you.

67
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:35,338
So, you pay at the cashier.
And good luck with the flight.

68
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:40,819
The flight....
I can fly, I'm not afraid.

69
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:47,129
Precisely...
You will do fine. Good luck.

70
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:52,778
- The package! Viking Bar.
- Viking Bar.

71
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,610
- Bye!
- Bye. -Next!

72
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,416
Fill out this form,
and have a seat and wait.

73
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,417
Hi there!

74
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:10,297
Hi! So, you don't like flying either.

75
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:17,258
I vaccinated myself and thought I could
attend some FOF-therapy as well.

76
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:23,330
- Will you take the diet guidance as well?
- No... Bye!

77
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,132
The package!

78
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:31,290
Could you print out these,
and call Dr Levander for me?

79
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:44,891
- Do you want some coffee?
- Yes please, just what I was thinking of...

80
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,457
How much is a wedding trip
to the Canary Islands?

81
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,688
- It depends on where you live.
- We live in Mjölby.

82
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:02,580
This is the addition for high season and
cancellation insurance and traveling insurance.

83
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:09,049
- This is the fuel addition.
- So many additions...

84
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:16,177
With SunTrips Trapp Trull-account you
divide the cost in three payments and get a sun hat -

85
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,531
- and a beach bag.

86
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:26,293
You can also buy this nice
SunTrip-shirt for only 15kr

87
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:33,133
- What is this?
- Nose protection, that's for free.

88
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:38,619
- Like this?
- Yes, that's right.

89
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,814
I wish you a Merry Christmas,
and a pleasant flight.

90
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,453
The Package!

91
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,780
He's
leptosome... indolent...

92
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,292
<i>Well, well, but what does he look like?</i>

93
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,609
He's dark, in his 40:ies,
glasses, moustache...

94
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:08,214
<i> I said the package was for a relative with
Epicondytilis humeri.</i>

95
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:13,494
<i>- So, what does that mean?
- Tennis elbow.</i>

96
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:20,219
<i>What's his name?
The one with moustache and glasses?</i>

97
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:26,529
Stig Helmer Olsson, 400703-0356

98
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:33,691
<i>It is half past nine and time for
the "Morning session" with Kjell Grane.</i>

99
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,738
<i>Good Morning! It will be nice to
move a little don't you think.</i>

100
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:52,178
<i>Wednesday the 19:th of December.
Be careful with the fat Christmas food.</i>

101
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:59,331
<i>We'll get rid of a little of it. Come on
and let's start slowly by jogging.</i>

102
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,498
<i>sneaking start.</i>

103
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,096
<i>elastic...</i>

104
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:15,058
<i>Sneaking, elastic...
Jogging start, jogging start...</i>

105
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,696
<i>flexible and light...</i>

106
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,776
<i>Bend and stretch your arms.
Fingers...</i>

107
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,939
<i>Try to do it rhythmically and nice.</i>

108
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,178
<i>Elastic feet - elastic...</i>

109
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:48,298
- I don't know.
- Look a pizza-racer!

110
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,652
We use to call them that at work.

111
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,578
- Are you alright?
- No scratch.

112
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,534
Not on your car either.

113
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:17,009
Take care now. Take it easy, mind
your heart. You did bring your medicine, right?

114
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:24,171
Here's a small package.
It is some Christmas food and a present.

115
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,578
I'll be at my mothers, so send the cards there.

116
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:35,219
I have to check in now.
Take care and a Merry Christmas to you.

117
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,538
Cherie has to say goodbye.

118
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,970
Bye...

119
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,696
The master is leaving us.
Merry Christmas, Master!


120
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:24,088
- Good morning and welcome. Name?
- Bramserud, Ole.

121
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,532
- Smoker or Non-smoker?
- Non-smoker.

122
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:34,292
- Hand luggage? It is a little big...
- Yes, but expensive!

123
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,857
- Gösta! Hi!
Hi!

124
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,258
- This is Maj-Britt, my sister.
- Hi!

125
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,851
- Haven't we met somewhere before?
- Yes we have.

126
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,612
- Where?
- Did it turn out ok redeeming the car?

127
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,450
- How was your name?
- Mrs Storch.

128
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,096
- Hunny.
- Just a moment.

129
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,772
- Hi there Robban!
- Hi Berra! How is it?

130
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:16,692
Sober this morning, but now it is
straightening out. Christmas party yesterday.

131
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,573
Oh, damn!

132
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:25,412
- Don't you have any luggage?
- I have this. I travel light.

133
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:32,692
- Good morning! How is your name?
- Stig Helmer Olsson.

134
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,937
Thank you. Hand luggage?

135
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:43,535
- Hi! Can you point out your luggage?
- It is that one.

136
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:50,976
- What are they doing?
- Routine check. Drugs, weapons, bombs...

137
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,650
Bombs...?!

138
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:10,413
- What's in the package?
- A present.

139
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,056
It isn't for me.

140
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:35,216
- We have to open this package.
- Sure, sure...

141
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,054
Nice dog.

142
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:51,818
Passport, bathing salt, toothbrush,
toothpaste, book. Is that all?

143
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,979
- What do you have in your bag?
- Some film.

144
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,810
Please take off your shoe.

145
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,737
Check out the terrorist!

146
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:35,370
<i>Mr Stork please contact
the information desk.</i>

147
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:41,291
- He has to be a brother to Lennart Swahn.
And Karin Falk!

148
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,778
And Magnus Uggla! (Uggla=Owl, all bird names)

149
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:54,577
- Hi there, Sulan!
Hi, Berra!

150
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,978
- How's it hanging?
Alright and you?

151
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,412
- Have you bought whine?
- It is 80% proof rum.

152
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:10,935
Did you know that you have a
chance of 50% to survive a flight accident?

153
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:17,136
It is more dangerous to drive a car than to fly.

154
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:23,973
It takes in between two and five million
flight hours per crash.

155
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,775
- Crash?
- Crash.

156
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:33,850
Here is Pepes Bodega.
It has a sign.

157
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:40,249
- They bottle up and everything?
- Sealed and ready.

158
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:46,410
- A million thanks for the tip! See you.
- Good luck. Bye!

159
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,217
Robban!

160
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:57,178
Sulan has been at Pepes Bodega.
They pour up 80% proof rum on whine bottles.

161
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,372
- Pepes Bodega.
- Never forget that!

162
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:06,496
Did you read about the jumbo jet-pilot
that performed a looping?

163
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,171
- Looping, with a jumbo?
- Twice.

164
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:18,775
Is that possible? Could you
watch my luggage for a while, I have to...

165
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:30,536
I can fly, I'm not afraid...
I can fly, I'm not afraid...

166
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,013
Are you alright?

167
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,293
- How do you feel?
- Good.

168
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:58,258
I'm practicing some yoga,
relaxation exercises. Isometric training...

169
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:03,136
Right... Well, I myself take a shot.
Do you want some?

170
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:09,131
- No thank you, I can't stand strong alcohol.
- No, who the hell does?

171
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,733
- Oh.. Hi!
- Hi!

172
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:21,253
- So we got on the same trip.
- Yes, it seems so.

173
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,533
- Hi!
- How nice...

174
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,217
<i>You kill me!</i>

175
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:40,008
Did you see how he was coming on to you?
He looked like a giraffe.

176
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:48,209
- Is there something going on?
- Quit it!

177
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,616
Cheers!

178
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,536
Did you bring the four P:s?
Pass, pesetas, pills, and pickets?

179
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:16,815
- I use a coil.
- Pass, pesetas, poil and pickets!

180
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,454
And palcohol!

181
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,258
Enter!

182
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:55,449
- What was that sound?
- The landing gear was put back up.

183
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,893
Hydraulics.
They are put back and the hatch closed.

184
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:07,050
It is so that the plane won't loose speed,
otherwise...

185
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,729
Look, the sun!

186
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:23,296
- How about the pizza-racer then? He gets five points.
- I give him six.

187
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,255
- And the giraffe? Four.
- Less than the pizza-racer?

188
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:33,534
He is so lost.
That gives a reduction.

189
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,971
Did you see the guy with the tape recorder?!

190
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:41,139
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

191
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,538
- It is good for the stomach!
- Sure...

192
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:00,053
- What a group of people!
- Surely they are nice.

193
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,218
Hopefully not engineers.

194
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:13,971
- What is that badge you have there?
- Hammarby. Have you heard of them?

195
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:20,972
No, the only Swedish villages (by=village)
I know of is Stockholm, Gothenburg...

196
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:25,014
This is a football team.

197
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,977
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

198
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:40,496
- How nice to get away!
- I'm not going away, I'm going home.

199
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:45,899
- So you live at the Canary Islands?

200
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:52,539
- Home celebrating Christmas then.
- Yes, visiting my family.

201
00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:00,013
- Where are you staying?
- At Nueva Estocolmo.

202
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,293
Then you won't see much of the Canary Islands!

203
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,334
- Won't I?
- No...

204
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:15,651
I could invite you to a place
where no tourists come to.

205
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:23,335
We could go out and
eat some real Spanish food.

206
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:28,136
That sounds nice.

207
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,777
<i>Mr Storch
please contact the cabin crew.</i>

208
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:41,010
- Was the pizza-racer nice?
- His name is José.

209
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:46,419
And he doesn't work in a pizzeria.

210
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:51,216
- Computer technician.
- Well, well... so when are you meeting him?

211
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:56,016
Do you think I set a date
with the first guy I meet?

212
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:02,090
OK... the bar at the hotel,
Wednesday at seven.

213
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,930
- Real Spanish restaurant.
- Gratulations!

214
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:14,376
My dream is to fly with a Concorde
from Paris to Rio.

215
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:20,177
2300km/h. That is what I call flying!

216
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:24,817
- Three times the speed of a bullet.
- Ugh...

217
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,136
And Rio...

218
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:34,018
The beaches, the girls, samba...
That is nice.

219
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:38,099
- The Canary Islands isn't so bad either.
- It will have to do.

220
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,816
- Hi! When are you to leave the rooms?
- At 12.

221
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,808
Place the bags outside of the reception.

222
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,978
Hi there!

223
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,813
- Affe, you'll take the transfer.
- But I had the night tour this night!

224
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,490
Gabbe could get them.
-Gabbe!

225
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:19,457
- You'll have to take the transfer on the A3.
- I've had two pig parties this week.

226
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:25,855
Yesterday you were supposed to help us with
the pool games and the table tennis.

227
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:31,532
- I have to be allowed to sleep.
- Don't make a fuss. I'll take it myself.

228
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:38,532
- May I ask when we are to leave the rooms?
- at 12. And leave your bags in the reception.

229
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,971
Thank you.

230
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:46,856
Don't yawn in the presence of guests.
Get some sleep sometimes.

231
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:51,850
And don't smoke in here!
And try to keep the schedule.

232
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:56,736
- Yes, daddy.
- And when are we to leave the rooms?

233
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:11,015
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your captain.
We are now flying over the Atlantic.</i>

234
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:16,294
<i>Estimated arrival is within one hour and 35 minutes.</i>

235
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,893
<i>The weather in Las Palmas is good.
Sun haze and 22 degrees.</i>

236
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:28,050
<i>I can also inform you that Stenmark (downhill skier)
is at a third place after the first race.</i>

237
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:50,094
Is this what you call a "warm dinner"?
This is not what I'm used to.

238
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:56,739
I didn't get this trip for free you know.
I paid 3000kr for it.

239
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:04,096
- I only paid 995. Last minute.
- The last I needed...!

240
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:11,934
- If you want some more juice...
- Yes, you only press here.

241
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,018
No...

242
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:20,055
- There?
- Yes.

243
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,613
No...!

244
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:31,010
Like this... to call the stewardess.
Juice, whiskey.

245
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,179
Excuse me...

246
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:44,090
Thank you. It isn't allowed to
drink your own alcohol.

247
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:51,729
If you don't take it easy on the drinks,
there might be a problem getting into Spain.

248
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:56,172
Take it easy,
we've been traveling before.

249
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:04,768
- Is it any good that one?
- Yes, one of those quartz, digital...

250
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:10,577
Input, output...
FM... Tape... Tape run...

251
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,738
A lot of stuff.

252
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:26,019
- Can you hear anything? Samba.
- Yes.

253
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,379
- Nice music!
- Sch...

254
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:02,615
If they crash, they throw tomatoes at the pilots.

255
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:09,771
Shape up, Berra!
Otherwise we'll have serious problems.

256
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,374
<i>Invalido.</i>

257
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,734
<i>Gracias.</i>

258
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:09,410
- I wonder how long you have to wait here.
- Take it easy, Gösta.

259
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:15,138
- I'll rent a car. Are you coming with me?
- No, we have too much luggage.

260
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:20,937
You have your golf bag and so.
No, we'll take the bus.

261
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,371
Well, well...

262
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:58,372
- see you at the hotel, as we said.
- Josito! Josito!

263
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:05,019
- It is my mum and dad. See you.
- See you. Give my regards to your family.

264
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:09,372
And the hens!

265
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:14,415
- Who is she?
- She sat next to me at the plane.

266
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:19,410
- No Swedish girls!
- I do as I like, mum.

267
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:26,537
- But I've sent you money for a car.
- We are saving the for your sisters wedding.

268
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:33,179
She'll never get married,
besides you scare everyone away.

269
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:47,453
Hi there! Are you a SunTrip-guest?

270
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:51,972
- Any problems?
- My bag hasn't arrived.

271
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:56,173
- Are you sure?
- Yes...

272
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,214
Then we'd better report it missing.

273
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:16,174
- Good day! His bag is missing.
- Just a moment.

274
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:23,331
Could you wait here. I have to
look after the other guests. See you!

275
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,930
SunTrips bus number 17 is over there!

276
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:25,458
- Las Palmas... good football team...

277
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,618
Highest division!

278
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:35,377
Hammarby is also a good team.

279
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,539
- Bajen...
- Hammarby... Bajen...

280
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,051
What bag?

281
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,219
Majsan, a nine pointer!

282
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:54,458
- Hello? One, two... can you hear me at the back?
- Yes!

283
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:58,653
- Was the trip alright?
- Yes!

284
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:04,173
Welcome to Nueva Estocolmo and SunTrip.

285
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:11,855
The time is three o'clock, Spanish time,
that is an hour behind Swedish time.

286
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:16,656
We will be serving a
welcoming drink at the hotel SunTrip.

287
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:25,450
The people living at Flamenco, will be
fetched with a coach at six, Spanish time.

288
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,696
You shouldn't drink the water.

289
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:37,373
The pig party is on Thursday
and costs 800 pesetas. Any questions?

290
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,539
- Is there Swedish coffee at the hotel?
- Yes.

291
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,971
- And Norwegian?
- Yes.

292
00:35:54,100 --> 00:36:00,255
- Are you feeling alright?
- I have a tendency of motion sickness.

293
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:06,092
- I have some pills against that.
- Do you?!

294
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,530
Nice!

295
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:15,293
Thank you.
Maybe you'd like an Argotal?

296
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,379
- Against allergies, but perhaps you're not...
- No.

297
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,054
Hi!

298
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,731
Problems. There is one room missing.

299
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:08,335
There is a small complication
because of an overbooking.

300
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:14,775
I wonder if Olsson, Stig Helmer...

301
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:18,211
... and Bramserud, Ole...

302
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:24,973
- Would it be possible for you to share a room?
- Yes.

303
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,137
<i>Do you call this a view of the sea?
- Momento.</i>

304
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,578
Sea view, look!

305
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:19,013
A little closer to the wall. Good!

306
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:24,135
Turn it a little to the left, towards me!
Like that!

307
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:29,209
Stop! There!

308
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,890
Ok?

309
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:38,049
- Listen!
- Yes, it is nice! Samba!

310
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:49,653
- What kind of watch is that?
- Digital and analog.

311
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:55,969
Spanish, Norwegian, Swedish time...
chronometer and watch.

312
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:02,653
And then there's a calculator
and an alarm clock.

313
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,296
Samba, as well.

314
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,653
Nice!

315
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:16,415
Pen, that can be used under water.
"Pool Pen".

316
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:23,298
- Under water?
- Swiss Army Knife. Can opener.

317
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:27,049
Magnifying glass with a screw driver...

318
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:32,334
- Scissors, without screw driver.
- Practical!

319
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:44,652
Camera... Focus...

320
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,772
Smile!

321
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:58,697
Camera two: Japanese, small, motor...

322
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:08,050
Flash... Tele lens... Normal...

323
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:15,579
- Do you have a camera?
- Yes.

324
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,777
Old...

325
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,739
But it has a flash.

326
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:37,172
- What do you want?
- Some sherry?

327
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:43,774
Are we on a bloody vernissage?
No, a big whiskey is what I need.

328
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:48,929
- To gather courage to hit on the giraffe?
- Quit it!

329
00:40:54,980 --> 00:41:01,374
Gösta wanted to have a drink in his room,
but I said that I have to unpack.

330
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:06,700
How wonderful to get away from Sweden.

331
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:14,090
- The really park anyway they like here.
- Relax, Majsan, you're on vacation.

332
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,259
I can't understand it.

333
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:24,169
Now the rush hour begins at home.

334
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:35,810
Welcome to our Island
Forget rain and snow.

335
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:42,095
Sun, bathe and have fun
with SunTrip this Christmas.

336
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,578
A hearty welcome to Gran Canaria!

337
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:52,412
We are at the level of Egypt
and 500 miles from home... and that's good.

338
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,376
- Has everyone gotten some sangria?
- Yes!

339
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:04,779
My name is Lasse and
I take care of the SunTrip "Healthoteque".

340
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:13,376
The "Healthoteque" starts at ten every morning,
some gymnastics and fun in the pool.

341
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:22,659
Raise your right hand, lay the 
left on your hart and say after me:

342
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:29,538
I promise to become a 
healthier person during my vacation.

343
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:36,930
I promise to become a 
healthier person during my vacation.

344
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:43,659
- Good! Let's promise us that.
- How cute he is!

345
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:49,856
Lasse takes care of your body,
gets your body into shape.

346
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:56,613
Jog, swim and feel good
with SunTrip everyday.

347
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:03,089
I'll present my colleagues:
Affe, on accordian.

348
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,091
And Gabbe on congas!

349
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:16,739
Gabbe is the one when it 
comes to the night tours.

350
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:27,569
If you'd like a nightclub tour,
then stick to Gabbe.

351
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:33,650
Visit discos,
with SunTrip every night

352
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:39,218
I would like to remind you of the Christmas party,
which is on Christmas eve.

353
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,493
With Swedish food and games.

354
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:51,209
Unbelievable to sit like this in December.
It is like in Rio.

355
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:58,371
- Have you been in Rio?
- No, but I intend to go there.

356
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:02,414
Is there a family called Stork here?

357
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:12,933
- Our name is Storch, not Stork.
- I'm sorry.

358
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,769
"To the bridal couple from Rutan and Nisse:"

359
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:23,328
"Go, Go, Go and don't stop trying, because in nine months comes the Stork."

360
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:28,455
- The Storch....?
- A round of applause!

361
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:36,135
I would like to bring out a toast for the couple.
Maybe the Groom would like to open the cork.

362
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,936
- Corch!
- Where from do you get everything, Olsson?

363
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:49,058
Four cheers for the bridal couple!
Hurray!, Hurray!, Hurray!, Hurray!

364
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:06,854
You can't walk around like that,
with those pants and the tie.

365
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:11,451
Take these shorts.

366
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:15,369
Nice of you.

367
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,971
You can borrow them.

368
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:23,616
I'll try them on.

369
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:34,813
It contained Christmas food, the present.

370
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:38,490
Don't worry about that.

371
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:43,569
We'll make a new one.

372
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:54,659
I wonder what "Dalahäst" (painted wooden horse)
is called in Spanish.

373
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:59,297
<i>Caballo folcloristico nativo.</i>

374
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:10,972
- Aren't they a bit too big?
- Let me see.

375
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:20,459
Great! And take this shirt as well.

376
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:32,015
- Isn't it a little too much?
No, you need strong colors.

377
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:38,812
Levander. Hallo?

378
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,534
Angerud, here.

379
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:47,019
- Did the present reach you?
- He hasn't left it yet.

380
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,452
<i>- And the customs?
- No problem.</i>

381
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:55,096
<i>And how's the weather back in Sweden?</i>

382
00:46:55,300 --> 00:47:02,012
The weather? Typical December weather,
22 degrees warm and sunshine of course.

383
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:07,852
<i>Same as here then. I'll keep in touch.
Hasta la vista!</i>

384
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:14,738
- Amazing that it can be so warm.
- We have to buy some flowers.

385
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:19,092
So that it looks like we're being called upon.

386
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:25,853
We have to use some
brown-without-sun before the exercise.

387
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:36,295
Did you see what big pants the Giraffe had?

388
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:42,336
- What's his name?
- You won't believe me!

389
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:47,534
- Say it!
- Stig Helmer.

390
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:54,851
You kill me! Stig Helmer...?

391
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:04,177
Apparently he lives with the Norwegian.
What they can offer, they have in Las Palmas.

392
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:08,658
Gösta invited us to dinner, 
but I said I've got a headache.

393
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:15,413
- If you drink more, you'll get it.
- I never drink whiskey back home.

394
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,216
- Swedish drinking song -

395
00:48:55,860 --> 00:49:02,493
- Do you really think we'll find a "dalahäst"?
- Don't worry, we'll think of something.

396
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:07,251
- Swimming pants.
- Thank you.

397
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:19,373
- What's that?
- To keep your money in when swimming.

398
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:25,257
- Are you coming to the pool with me?
- No, not the pool.

399
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:31,137
My eyes can't stand chlorine,
they get all read.

400
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:34,412
Can't we go to the beach?

401
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:39,375
It is dangerous. Between two 
and three people die everyday...

402
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:44,574
... because of currents, sunstroke and sharks.

403
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,214
Here.

404
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:54,608
- What's this?
- Against chlorine.

405
00:49:54,820 --> 00:50:01,532
And pick up balls with the left,
and the right... pick up balls.

406
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:06,097
Like that, nice! Good! Pick up balls.

407
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:12,409
Pick with the right, pick with 
the left. Like that! Nice!

408
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,858
Check out the Stork!

409
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:24,657
How do they have the energy?

410
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:32,892
Damn... Herr Ober? They havent opened yet.
But it is almost ten.

411
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:39,619
- Shouldn't we eat some breakfast first?
- We'll do that here. Bacon and Egg liqueur.

412
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:52,010
Reach out and back again.

413
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:57,692
That was it for today.
I hope I didn't push you too hard.

414
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:02,974
See you all tomorrow.
Thank you all.

415
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:07,890
Check it out...
Apparently it is supposed to be lamb meat.

416
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:31,018
Hi there.

417
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,134
Hi.

418
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:48,011
Gösta! Hi.

419
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:53,214
- Aren't you going to sunbathe?
- I have some business to attend to.

420
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:57,413
- Dinner tomorrow night?
- I already have plans.

421
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:02,740
- With who?
- The nice Spaniard on the plane.

422
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:11,177
- We are going to a real Spanish restaurant.
- Real Spanish restaurant?

423
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:15,931
- You are working for SunTrip, right?
- Yes.

424
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:20,258
Could you run upstairs to my room
and fetch my smokes.

425
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:27,411
- It isn't included in my obligations.
- Is that so? Do you call this service?

426
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:32,171
- I'll talk to the local manager.
- That's me.

427
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:38,819
- Do you realize that I know the owner?
- Then give him my regards. Bye.

428
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:43,093
That's the last time
I travel with SunTrip!

429
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:50,980
- Shall we try to find Pepes Bodega today?
- Can't we take it easy?

430
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:56,777
Then I use to say that I'm on the street.

431
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:02,179
- So, what do you do?
- I'm working in an electrical warehouse.

432
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:10,572
If you buy a toaster, and it says:
"Controlled by G17", then it is by me.

433
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:17,492
It is only temporarily.
I'm studying engineering at half speed.

434
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:22,171
- Do you like football too?
- How did you know?

435
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:25,736
Just guessing.

436
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:30,411
- Could you smear my back?
- Sure.

437
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:36,369
Don't use too much,
it can begin to boil.

438
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,537
What are you doing?!

439
00:53:54,780 --> 00:54:00,298
And there you're running after Swedish girls,
when there are some many nice Spanish ones.

440
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:04,459
The neighboring girl, Juanita, for example.

441
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:11,932
I'm not marrying any Swedish girl,
I'm just taking her out for dinner.

442
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:17,134
Your sister is working
and caring for her parents.

443
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:25,020
You should take after her. Not
fooling around with Swedish girls.

444
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:31,534
- Do you think that Gösta got sour?
- He didn't look happy.

445
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:36,256
He shouldn't think he owns me
just because he bought the trip.

446
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:43,650
- What did the Giraffe say?
- Nothing special. He seems shy.

447
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:48,809
- He is studying engineering.
- No...!

448
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:55,448
Not again, Majsan!

449
00:54:55,660 --> 00:55:00,131
- He likes football as well.
- And baked beans?

450
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:03,730
I didn't ask.


451
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:10,379
Here it is. Please enter.
Welcome into the green.

452
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:18,769
Bungalow, four rooms and kitchen.

453
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:24,699
Luxurious kitchen with fridge and freezer.

454
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:30,133
And a dishwasher, if you'd like.

455
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:36,051
Small garden. Here in front of the house.

456
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:39,297
Swimming pool.

457
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:45,496
Three meters deep in one end,
one meter in the other. Suitable for kids.

458
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:52,253
Wall-to-wall carpets in all rooms...
for a mere extra cost.

459
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:58,933
- Do you play golf? A wonderful game.
- 50000 is the deposit.


460
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:02,098
- I counted on that, what is your handicap?
- 22.

461
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,451
These bungalows are very sought-after.

462
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:10,290
Shall we go a round tomorrow,
before we seal the deal?

463
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:17,850
My client will be satisfied with this.
What a marvelous view!

464
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:23,532
- Living room in jacaranda...
- Shall I come and pick you up at four?

465
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,731
... or some other type of wood.

466
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:55,939
And you're talking about how expensive time is...

467
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:20,130
Here it says...

468
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:25,778
"Balcony with a view of the sea and evening sun."

469
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:30,929
SunTrip. Hi there.

470
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:37,249
From the fourth floor? Down into the pool?
Call the clinic.

471
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:43,695
It is a custom to have
a bottle of champagne in the room.

472
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:47,290
SunTrip.

473
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:52,096
Shark in the pool?
Delirium, call the clinic.

474
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:58,614
As I was saying, it is the last time 
I'll travel with SunTrip.

475
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:23,139
- Has my bag arrived?
- I'm sorry, no.

476
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:27,458
Then we'll make a new package.

477
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:34,179
It was so cold in the room tonight,
even though we've paid for a fuel addition.

478
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,894
Fuel addition?

479
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:47,737
This bag is for Las Palmas.

480
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:54,493
The sun is really hot down here, Robban.

481
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:00,298
Look.

482

00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:08,370
If you'll stand there I'll take a picture.

483
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:12,016
- Like this?
- Yes.

484
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:21,373
Say cheese.

485
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:26,529
- It is about this size.
- Wait I'll take a look.

486
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:35,493
- No, there's none.
- Are you sure?

487
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:43,614
This one is nice.

488
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:47,096
Hi there!

489
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:51,088
- How much?
- 500 pesetas.

490
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:56,420
- 500? Too expensive. 200?
- No...

491
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:03,219
I bid 200 for it.
That's... 18 Norwegian crowns.

492
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:09,097
- No, 500.
- Two...

493
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:13,259
400 pesetas. 
Look, it is very funny.

494
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:21,092
- Not so funny. 200.
- No, 500 pesetas.

495
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:28,297
- First, second, third... 200 pesetas!
- Ok.

496
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,458
<i>Poor favor.</i>

497
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:34,538
(in Swedish). Stingy bastards.

498
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:40,813
Nice donkey. What will they think of next?

499
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:48,415
- There's supposed to be some flowers here.
- Ok, no problem.

500
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:51,180
We can do anything!

501
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:05,533
Left, right... you're doing fine.

502
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:11,690
Left again, one more with your right
and now both.

503
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:45,051
...with rye in your back!

504
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:48,809
That one was good!

505
01:01:54,140 --> 01:02:00,579
- The criminality has risen since Franco died.
- People don't have any respect for the Police.

506
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:05,376
They got their democratical rights 
a little too fast.

507
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:08,333
It was better during Francos regime.

508
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:14,979
It is the same in Sweden.
Frightening development, no morale.

509
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:27,816
I pay a penalty of one stroke.
I strike my fourth.

510
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:32,810
Adjust the thumb a little to the left...

511
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:40,729
I'll take an used ball.

512
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:50,769
I hit my seventh stroke.

513
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:12,616
Now the damn thing is growing down the hole!

514
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:00,618
<i>Look, very funny!</i>

515
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:06,531
- And we'll paint it red.
- And some flowers there.

516
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:10,779
Those redheaded girls are really nice.

517
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:15,531
- What's their names? Maj-Britt and Siv?
- Yes.

518
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:20,370
- We should make a move.
- How?

519
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:25,176
My apologies. I don't know what came over me.

520
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:31,899
Must've been the heat.
Never happened before.

521
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:35,536
It is easy to flare up.

522
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:41,491
About the deposit...

523
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:46,820
We could ask the reception to
put some flowers in their rooms.

524
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:49,978
Flowers?

525
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:56,255
Do you have any other suggestions?
Melons, cucumbers, bananas?

526
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:04,890
- But flowers... do you do that in Norway?
- The flower language is international.

527
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:13,099
- Have you never given a girl flowers?
- No.

528
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:20,695
Then I suggest that you and I
pick some flowers for Siv and Maj-Britt.

529
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:23,016
Pick flowers...

530
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:35,653
<i>Buenas dias, my little Viking.
Has the package arrived yet?</i>

531
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:43,658
Here you are.

532
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:53,013
"Merry Christmas, aunty."

533
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:59,819
- How did the person look like that left this package?
- He was tall, dark hair...

534
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:04,457
... glasses and a moustache.

535
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:07,891
Then we're clear.

536
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:13,732
We are on the south of Gran Canaria
and the sea is there, right.

537
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:17,899
Then the bodega must be that way.

538
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:27,537
- I'm thirsty, Berra.
- You have no character at all, Robban.

539
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:33,690
- Shall we go inside here or over there?
- Doesn't matter.

540
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:31,136
Do you think he's the lick-in-the ear type?
I mean when he dances.

541
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:37,449
- We're only going out to eat!
- Bring pepper.

542
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:44,293
If he gets too close,
you can throw it in his face.

543
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:51,099
Spaniards can get very frustrated
with Swedish girls. Take this.

544
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:57,011
Such prejudice you have! Have you ever
been out with a Spaniard?

545
01:07:57,220 --> 01:08:03,056
- You seem so experienced.
- Maybe I have.

546
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:08,618
- I only want what's best for you.
- I can take care of myself.

547
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:11,778
You'd better take care of the Giraffe.

548

01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:15,529
Cabin two.

549
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:28,009
<i>This is Dr Levanders
automatic answering machine.</i>

550
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:34,693
<i>The solarium, the fear-of-flight clinic, 
the diet and the herb store are closed for Christmas.</i>

551
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:42,853
<i>important messages can be left
at the hotel Ambassador in Åre.</i>

552
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:48,738
<i>This is Dr Levanders automatic...</i>

553
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:56,213
Señor, pay!

554
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:21,412
Did you know it was 
18 degrees cold in Sweden today?

555
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:24,054
Thank you.

556
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:30,134
Canarian Specialty!

557
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:36,415
<i>Ropa vieja - old clothes.</i>

558
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:41,250
- What did you say?
- Old clothes.

559
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:45,009
It is like fried diced meat
with onions and potatoes.

560
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:59,090
- But it could use some more spices.
- Wait.

561
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:05,779
Could I have...?

562
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:09,017
Sorry, nothing.

563
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:23,735
Are you sure it doesn't 
matter that my mom came along?

564
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:35,571
- Doesn't she want to have a seat by our table?
- No, she doesn't want to be in the way.

565
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:59,573
A painted donkey...?! The idea with the 
package was idiotical from the beginning.

566
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:03,568
You'll have to get the money back.

567
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:10,094
You can't contact the police! What will you say? 
That 50 000 smuggled crowns are missing?

568
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:15,818
Talk to him. He might want a finders reward.
Do something!

569
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:24,332
Hi! Are you already back?
How did it go?

570
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:29,898
- I got a use for the pepper.
- What did I tell you?

571
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:36,539
You won't believe it.
Have you ever eaten old clothes?

572
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:42,736
He came and picked me up.
Guess who he brought with him.

573
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:46,933
- Guess!
- Who?

574
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:50,849
His mom!

575
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:17,258
And now relax and lumber 
like a troll. Like that, good!

576
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:20,054
Just lumber on.

577
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:34,329
Do you want some B-vitamins?
They are good for the liver.

578
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:41,218
- There's an upcoming pig fest you know. Take two.
- Oh, ok.

579
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:51,378
And I have C-vitamins...
Iron pills, ginseng, toothpaste...?

580
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:54,458
I'm fine, thank you.

581
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:05,134
If you don't find a lady at the pig party,
then it is over.


582
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:11,779
- Do you think they have received our flowers?
- Sure. Tonight we make our move.

583
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:20,296
Do you remember Benidorm?
Talk about pig party.

584
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:24,209
Was I there? Did I have fun?

585
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:30,859
How wonderful to be in the heat all the year!
What do you do for a living then?

586
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:35,815
- A couple more.
- No, damn it. I have my car at Arlanda.

587
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:47,449
Fataga is one of the few original villages
left here on Gran Canaria.

588
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:56,656
If...

589
01:13:56,860 --> 01:14:02,651
If you want to buy their embroideries, don't haggle.

590
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:08,696
Haggeling and such is for the market.

591
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:35,769
Poor people living like this.

592
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:43,773
Poor people. Dragged around at 
day like a flock of sheep.

593
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:49,179
There's Josés mother!

594
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:55,499
There's her, the one that 
wants to take my Josito away.

595
01:14:55,700 --> 01:15:02,412
- Don't you want to by something from your mother in law?
- Stop it! I'll go for Ole from now on.

596
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:08,536
- I have nu prejudice against Norwegians.
- Only if they go hiking...

597
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:50,450
Do you think that the Norwegian and 
the Giraffe bought the flowers?


598
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:53,254
- Or Gösta.
- No.

599
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:59,649
- Why is he so depressed?
- He has some problem with buying the house.

600
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:07,130
- Ouch!
- Hi. Can I have a seat?

601
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:19,978
- It has gotten really expensive here.
- Yes, almost like in Sweden soon.

602
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:25,129
You have to have a lot of Swedish 
money with you... if you know what I mean.

603
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:29,015
Always good with some reserves.

604
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:36,171
So that you can buy your
daily bread... if you know what I mean.

605
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:42,215
As I said, you've got to have 
money for your daily bread.

606
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:50,008
- Because people are stealing allot here.
- Yeah, so I've heard as well.

607
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:57,058
But it's not the same to 
find something as to steal.

608
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:59,774
No, that's true.

609
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:05,452
Because if you find something,
there might be a reward. Keep that in mind.

610
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:09,893
Ouch! I'll do that.

611
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:24,856
- He was really strange!
- It is the combination of sun and...

612
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:28,052
- Yepp.
- Dangerous stuff.

613
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:37,172
This is really the countryside.
We must've gone too far.

614
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:45,490
- Damn I'm thirsty.
- Yepp, it can't be out here.

615
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:50,491
Well, well, Berra.
Let's head back.

616
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:55,057
I won't take another footstep.
Lets hitchhike.

617
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:01,739
- Go Eslöv!
- God damn it.

618
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:19,494
There was one that didn't stop.
Thank you very much, bastard.

619
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:22,851
- That one!
He stops. Come on!

620
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:30,929
- The smell!

- Doesn't matter, we don't have to walk!

621
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:34,689
- Hi there!
- Talk about pig party.


622
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:56,618
- The Sangria, boys.
- We're coming.

623
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:25,260
Such skill they have!

624
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:30,450
- It is hot in here. Aren't you going to dance?
- No, it feels awkward to ask the girls to dance.

625
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:36,929
You just say:
"Shall we dance? Hi there."

626
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:44,929
Or you can use something more fancy.
Like this.

627
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:49,213
<i>Voulez-vous danser avec moi?
It is French.</i>

628
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:57,134
I'm afraid they'll turn me down.
If she doesn't want to dance, you look stupid.

629
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:03,813
With you...?! No, give it a try.
Just lean back.

630
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:07,854
- Would you like to dance with me?
- May I...

631
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:10,290
Now she was asked.

632
01:21:56,868 --> 01:22:00,781
Damn it...!

633
01:22:08,388 --> 01:22:11,141
<i>Buenas noches, señor.</i>

634
01:22:23,428 --> 01:22:26,784
<i>Un moment.</i>

635
01:22:44,148 --> 01:22:48,141
Thank you, my friends.
Welcome.

636
01:22:48,348 --> 01:22:53,706
I bid six men, maybe you
and the others, to come up here.

637
01:22:53,908 --> 01:22:56,547
Dance!

638
01:23:02,108 --> 01:23:04,861
Go Norway!

639
01:24:04,148 --> 01:24:10,383
- I've been robbed
- Poor thing.

640
01:24:10,588 --> 01:24:17,061
And the woman I love doesn't want me.

641
01:24:17,268 --> 01:24:23,059
- Everything will be fine.
- You women don't understand your own best.

642
01:24:23,268 --> 01:24:28,501
But you seem like a
nice person, Carmencita.

643
01:24:31,108 --> 01:24:33,941
One more Viking special.

644
01:24:39,228 --> 01:24:42,459
Get up.

645
01:24:56,548 --> 01:25:01,668
- Did you buy the flowers?
- Yes, but it was the idea of Ole.

646
01:25:01,868 --> 01:25:06,464
- I found it sweet of you.
- Do you?

647
01:25:06,668 --> 01:25:13,221
But you have to swap water and 
give them a pill against headache every fourth hour.

648
01:25:13,428 --> 01:25:17,387
- The flowers...?
- Yes.

649
01:25:21,748 --> 01:25:27,106
- Shall we go for some fresh air?
- Yes, that would be nice.

650
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:53,265
<i>Look, no hands.</i>

651
01:26:22,308 --> 01:26:28,702
- Now, I have to close.
- Carmencita, don't disappoint me.

652
01:26:28,908 --> 01:26:32,947
- Where are you staying?
- Hotel Flamenco.

653
01:26:33,148 --> 01:26:37,346
- Come on.
- 50 000...!

654
01:26:39,428 --> 01:26:47,221
I love these warm nights.

655
01:26:47,428 --> 01:26:53,060
Soon one's about to go home to the slush again.
I don't want to go home.

656
01:26:53,268 --> 01:26:59,343
- I'm a bit afraid of the flight.
- I can fly, I'm not afraid.

657
01:27:00,388 --> 01:27:03,539
Levander should see us now!

658
01:27:09,708 --> 01:27:15,226
Majsan, bring the Giraffe
and let's go to the Tonga Tonga.

659
01:27:37,788 --> 01:27:41,576
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

660
01:28:08,108 --> 01:28:15,184
- Samba is nice!
- What did you say?!

661
01:28:15,388 --> 01:28:18,346

Samba!

662
01:28:21,228 --> 01:28:27,178
Do...do you like baked beans?

663
01:28:27,388 --> 01:28:30,619
I hate them!

664
01:28:32,788 --> 01:28:35,700
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

665
01:28:39,628 --> 01:28:43,940
Berra.... Berra!

666
01:28:45,988 --> 01:28:53,099
- Can you help me to carry (carry = almost "berra") Berra?
- What language! "bärra hem Berra"!

667
01:29:10,748 --> 01:29:15,697
- I'll help you.
Carmencita, don't you disappoint me. (Swedish song)

668
01:29:15,908 --> 01:29:21,938
I'm going to get a job here in the store.

669
01:29:25,268 --> 01:29:28,066
113

670
01:29:28,268 --> 01:29:33,786
It isn't allowed to bring 
ladies in to the rooms.

671
01:29:33,988 --> 01:29:38,664
But for 500 pesetas, maybe 
we can come to an agreement.

672
01:29:38,868 --> 01:29:41,826
I'm helping him into his room.

673
01:29:42,028 --> 01:29:45,577
500 pesetas...?
It is my wife.

674
01:29:45,788 --> 01:29:51,545
- I don't believe you.
- Cigarette, darling?

675
01:29:51,748 --> 01:29:56,105
- No thank you, I don't smoke.
- Right, your wife...?

676
01:30:03,108 --> 01:30:06,020
May the devil take all women!

677
01:30:20,108 --> 01:30:24,784
Carmencita? What is this supposed to mean?

678
01:30:24,988 --> 01:30:31,018
- Where have you been all night?
- I followed a customer to his hotel.

679
01:30:31,228 --> 01:30:36,860
Oh My God!
You'll be my death.

680
01:30:37,068 --> 01:30:42,142
- How can you do this to your mother?!
- I'm 28 years old, mom.

681
01:30:42,348 --> 01:30:46,660
- You have to make a confession today.
- You are insane.

682
01:30:46,868 --> 01:30:52,226
Your brother is a nice boy. He comes
al the way from Sweden to visit me.

683
01:30:52,428 --> 01:30:58,537
But you on the other hand....
Now you'll have to marry him.

684
01:30:58,748 --> 01:31:02,297
Marry? You are insane.

685
01:31:02,508 --> 01:31:07,662
The shame! Wait until your 
father gets to hear this.

686
01:31:07,868 --> 01:31:13,784
I'll wake him up.
He'll have to go and talk to this man.

687
01:31:30,828 --> 01:31:36,061
- I think it is at the door.
- Maybe the cleaning lady.

688
01:31:46,908 --> 01:31:53,347
- Hammarby...?
- Yes!

689
01:32:01,588 --> 01:32:04,341
How nice! Thank you.

690
01:32:04,548 --> 01:32:07,745
<i>Momento!</i>

691
01:32:08,948 --> 01:32:11,746
Hammarby.

692
01:32:15,228 --> 01:32:18,186
<i>Momento!</i>

693
01:32:23,068 --> 01:32:29,337
- Reward.
- Thank you.

694
01:32:35,628 --> 01:32:39,860
- Morning, my boy.
- Morning.

695
01:32:40,068 --> 01:32:44,823
<i>- Feliz navidad.
- What did you say?</i>

696
01:32:45,028 --> 01:32:51,866
- It means Merry Christmas in Spanish.
- Right, it is Christmas today.

697
01:32:53,988 --> 01:32:59,938
- And the weather is nice.
- Are you going out to sunbathe?

698
01:33:00,148 --> 01:33:06,383
- Or shall we make a small excursion?
- I would like to go to the party.

699
01:33:09,428 --> 01:33:12,261
It is so bright!

700
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:18,218
- Can I come?
- Of course.

701
01:33:19,308 --> 01:33:25,383
But you have to bring food
and a present worth 100 pesetas.

702
01:33:25,588 --> 01:33:32,460
- Then I'll bring some herring and Stig Helmer.
- Norwegian humor.

703
01:33:36,308 --> 01:33:39,300
Come here my little darling.

704
01:33:40,348 --> 01:33:47,902
We bought paint and painted the donkey
like a "dalahäst" and put it into the package.

705
01:33:48,108 --> 01:33:51,498
After that we left it at the Viking Bar.

706
01:33:56,668 --> 01:33:59,899
What a tale!

707
01:34:01,228 --> 01:34:06,666
If the lady already got her food, 
you could bring this to the party.

708
01:34:06,868 --> 01:34:13,819
- SunTrip has a Christmas party today.
- Do we have to go?

709
01:34:14,028 --> 01:34:16,986
Don't be so Swedish.

710
01:34:17,188 --> 01:34:21,784
Isn't it typically Swedish to have
a Christmas party among the palms.

711
01:34:21,988 --> 01:34:28,177
You could come just for me?
I've bought you a present.

712
01:34:28,388 --> 01:34:31,983
Did you?

713
01:34:38,308 --> 01:34:42,301
- Let's sing "Tomtegubbarna".
- Yes!

714
01:34:59,948 --> 01:35:04,066
- Cheers and merry Christmas!
- Cheers.

715
01:35:14,108 --> 01:35:21,947
You have to remove the cover.
You know you have to remove it, don't you?

716
01:35:22,148 --> 01:35:28,906
<i>- It is this lens capturing.
- No, this one. I have the same one at home.</i>

717
01:35:30,388 --> 01:35:36,702
- Have you filmed like this for a long time?
- The whole week.

718
01:35:36,908 --> 01:35:41,186
Thats a pity.
Then there won't be any film.

719
01:35:41,388 --> 01:35:44,664
- No film...?!
- No.


720
01:35:51,988 --> 01:35:54,866
Out! Get out!

721
01:35:59,108 --> 01:36:04,341
Now there's time to hand out the presents.

722
01:36:07,428 --> 01:36:12,377
- This one is for you. Merry Christmas.
- And this one is for you.

723
01:36:29,708 --> 01:36:32,302
Robban!

724
01:36:34,668 --> 01:36:39,219
I found Peppes Bodega!

725
01:36:39,428 --> 01:36:46,061
- I'll be damned! Where was it?
- Here!

726
01:36:46,268 --> 01:36:50,546
It is on the other side of the hotel.

727
01:36:50,748 --> 01:36:56,380
And we've searched through 
the whole of Nueva Estocolmo!

728
01:36:56,588 --> 01:36:59,546
I've always wanted one of these.

729
01:37:04,188 --> 01:37:06,258
Thank you.

730
01:37:09,108 --> 01:37:11,986
I wonder where Gösta is.

731
01:37:17,028 --> 01:37:20,782
Hi there. How are you doing?

732
01:37:23,028 --> 01:37:30,184
Well... I had to sell the land
this morning. They signed.

733
01:37:30,388 --> 01:37:36,224
- You've brought shame over our family!
- It is not him. The other one!

734
01:37:36,428 --> 01:37:41,183
- So old! You're sending me to the grave!
- He isn't that old.

735
01:37:41,388 --> 01:37:46,462
Merry Christmas!
Woops, am I in the middle of something?

736
01:37:46,668 --> 01:37:51,537
- Gösta, are you coming to the Christmas party?
- Out! Get out!

737
01:37:51,748 --> 01:37:54,308
Out, out, out!

738
01:38:09,668 --> 01:38:13,581
Those Swedes are crazy!

739
01:38:16,628 --> 01:38:20,416
And what are you looking at?!

740
01:39:01,788 --> 01:39:04,746
Hi there!

741
01:39:07,068 --> 01:39:11,983
Nice dog.
We can send you home on Saturday.

742
01:39:15,868 --> 01:39:22,421
Could you do the doctor a flavor?
He has a nephew in Stockholm...

743
01:39:29,148 --> 01:39:36,463
- I can fly, I'm not afraid.
- The mail.

744
01:39:37,828 --> 01:39:45,508
- I can fly, I'm not afraid.
- I can fly, I'm not afraid.


745
01:39:45,708 --> 01:39:50,543
Rio...?!

746
01:42:12,828 --> 01:42:15,103
